# BalloonShoot

BalloonShoot is a simple balloon-popping game developed using MonoGame and C#. The objective is to click on the moving balloons before they float off the screen. Each hit increases your score, while missed balloons reduce it. The game becomes more challenging as the balloons speed up with each successful hit.
