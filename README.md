# BalloonShoot

BalloonShoot is a simple balloon-popping game developed using MonoGame and C#. The objective is to click on the moving balloons before they float off the screen. Each hit increases your score, while missed balloons reduce it. The game becomes more challenging as the balloons speed up with each successful hit.

## Game Overview

- **Platform**: Windows (using MonoGame)
- **Programming Language**: C#

## Features

- **Balloon Movement**: Balloons appear at the bottom of the screen and float upward.
- **Score Tracking**: Gain points by hitting balloons and lose points if they go off-screen.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Balloon speed increases with each successful hit.
- **Crosshair Cursor**: A custom crosshair replaces the mouse cursor for aiming.
- **Pop Effect**: A pop texture briefly appears when a balloon is hit.

## Controls

- **Left Mouse Click**: Pop the balloon by clicking on it before it reaches the top of the screen.
- **Escape**: Exit the game.

## How to Play

1. Start the game to see balloons appear at the bottom of the screen.
2. Aim with the crosshair and click on the balloons to pop them.
3. Each hit will increase your score, and each missed balloon will decrease it.
